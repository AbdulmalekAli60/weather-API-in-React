# WeatherApp in React JS

## Description
This project is a WeatherApp built using React JS. It serves as a practical application of the concepts and skills I have learned previously, including creating context providers, passing props, making API requests, accessing user location, and utilizing libraries like Moment and i18n.

## Features

- **User Journey:** The user journey begins with granting access to their location. The application then uses this information to make an API request and retrieve the current temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, and the city name.

- **Multi-language Support:** The website supports two languages - English and Arabic. It achieves this by converting the English names of cities using a JSON file containing all the city names in Arabic in Saudi Arabia.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: The project is built using the React JS library, which provides a flexible and efficient way to develop user interfaces.

- Moment: The Moment library is utilized for handling and formatting dates and times, enhancing the user experience.

- i18n: The i18n library is used to enable multi-language support in the application, allowing users to switch between Arabic and English seamlessly.

## Usage

To use the WeatherApp:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Access the website through your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
